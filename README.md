# ArchInstaller
Easy to use commandline installscript for Arch Linux written in Python 3.6.

Can only run on an Arch Linux installation live system.

Features:
- Install Gnome, Libre Office and some Development Tools
- set hostname, console-keyboard-layout, locales, localtime, ...
- Install and configure GRUB on 64-bit EFI and non-EFI systems

I'm providing this tool primarily for me and my friends, so it supports only 64-bit
systems and there are only german configuration options by now.

Note: The "Configure Remote Help" menu-option is only available to us.

## Usage
Download the Python file via "<http://tinyurl.com/crapArchInst>", make it executable
and execute it.
